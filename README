A simple OpenCL application that enumerates all possible platform and
device properties. Inspired by AMD's program of the same name, it is
coded in pure C99 and it tries to output all possible information,
including that provided by platform-specific extensions, and not to
crash on platform-unsupported properties (e.g. 1.2 properties on 1.1
platforms).

Building requires an OpenCL SDK (or at least OpenCL headers and
development files), and the standard build environment for the
platform. No special build system is used (autotools, CMake, meson,
ninja, etc), as I feel it would be overengineering for such a simple
program. Simply running `make` at the project root should work.
